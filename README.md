Following Adrian Rosebruck, Ph.D. (c.f. Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python, 3rd Edition, 2019, pyimagesearch.com), I am using input shape of 227x227 instead of the 224x224 indicated in the diagram.

I am simplifying a few things at this point, I am mostly looking at the layers.  I am avoiding a few details such as the initialization scheme.
